                                                  Fela Aníkúlápó Kuti (born Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti; 
                                                  15 October 1938 - 2 August 1997), also known as Abami Eda, was a 
                                                  Nigerian multi-instrumentalist, bandleader, composer, political activist, 
                                                  and Pan-Africanist. He is regarded as the pioneer of Afrobeat, an African 
                                                  music genre that combines West African music with American funk and 
                                                  jazz. At the height of his popularity, he was referred to as one of Africa's 
                                                  most "challenging and charismatic music performers. AllMusic described 
                                                  him as a musical and sociopolitical voice of international significance.

                                                  Kuti was the son of Nigerian women's rights activist Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti. 
                                                  After early experiences abroad, he and his band Africa 70 (featuring drummer 
                                                  and musical director Tony Allen) shot to stardom in Nigeria during the 1970s, 
                                                  during which he was an outspoken critic and target of Nigeria's military juntas.
                                                  In 1970, he founded the Kalakuta Republic commune, which declared itself 
                                                  independent from military rule. The commune was destroyed in a 1978 raid. 
                                                  He was jailed by the government of Muhammadu Buhari in 1984, but released 
                                                  after 20 months.

                                        <p>
                                                  Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti was born into the Ransome-Kuti 
                                                  family, an upper-middle-class Nigerian family, on 15 October 1938 in 
                                                  Abeokuta (the modern-day capital of Ogun State), which at the time was a 
                                                  city in the British Colony of Nigeria. His mother, Chief Funmilayo 
                                                  Ransome-Kuti, was an anti-colonial feminist, and his father, Reverend 
                                                  Israel Oludotun Ransome-Kuti, was an Anglican minister, school principal, 
                                                  and the first president of the Nigeria Union of Teachers. His brothers Beko 
                                                  Ransome-Kuti and Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, both medical doctors, were well 
                                                  known nationally. Kuti was a first cousin to reknowned writer and 
                                                  Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka, the first black African to win the Nobel Prize 
                                                  for Literature, as they are both descendants of Josiah Ransome-Kuti, who is 
                                                  Kuti's paternal grandfather and Soyinka's maternal great-grandfather.

                                        <p>
                                                  Kuti attended Abeokuta Grammar School. In 1958, he was sent to London 
                                                  to study medicine but decided to study music instead at the Trinity College 
                                                  of Music, with the trumpet being his preferred instrument. While there, he 
                                                  formed the band Koola Lobitos and played a fusion of jazz and highlife. 
                                                  In 1960, Kuti married his first wife, Remilekun (Remi) Taylor, with whom 
                                                  he had three children (Femi, Yeni, and Sola). In 1963, Kuti moved back 
                                                  to the newly independent Federation of Nigeria, re-formed Koola Lobitos, 
                                                  and trained as a radio producer for the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation. 
                                                  He played for some time with Victor Olaiya and his All-Stars.

                                                  After Kuti and his band returned to Nigeria, the group was renamed (the) 
                                                  Africa '70 as lyrical themes changed from love to social issues. He formed 
                                                  the Kalakuta Republic—a commune, recording studio, and home for many 
                                                  people connected to the band—which he later declared independent from the 
                                                  Nigerian state.

                                                  Kuti set up a nightclub in the Empire Hotel, first named the Afro-Spot 
                                                  and later the Afrika Shrine, where he both performed regularly and 
                                                  officiated at personalised Yoruba traditional ceremonies in honor of 
                                                  his nation's ancestral faith. He also changed his name to Anikulapo 
                                                  (meaning "He who carries death in his pouch", with the interpretation: 
                                                  "I will be the master of my own destiny and will decide when it is time 
                                                  for death to take me"). He stopped using the hyphenated surname 
                                                  "Ransome" because he considered it a slave name.

                                        <p>
                                                  Kuti's music was popular among the Nigerian public and Africans 
                                                  in general. He decided to sing in Pidgin English so that individuals 
                                                  all over Africa could enjoy his music, where the local languages 
                                                  they speak are diverse and numerous. As popular as Kuti's music 
                                                  had become in Nigeria and elsewhere, it was unpopular with the 
                                                  ruling government, and raids on the Kalakuta Republic were frequent. 
                                                  During 1972, Ginger Baker recorded Stratavarious, with Kuti appearing 
                                                  alongside vocalist and guitarist Bobby Tench. Around this time, Kuti 
                                                  became even more involved with the Yoruba religion.

                                                  In 1983, Kuti nominated himself for president[5] in Nigeria's first elections 
                                                  in decades, but his candidature was refused. At this time, Kuti created a new 
                                                  band, Egypt 80, which reflected the view that Egyptian civilization, knowledge, 
                                                  philosophy, mathematics, and religious systems are African and must be claimed 
                                                  as such. Kuti stated in an interview: "Stressing the point that I have to make 
                                                  Africans aware of the fact that Egyptian civilization belongs to the African. 
                                                  So that was the reason why I changed the name of my band to Egypt 80." 
                                                  Kuti continued to record albums and tour the country. He further infuriated 
                                                  the political establishment by implicating ITT Corporation's vice-president, 
                                                  Moshood Abiola, and Obasanjo in the popular 25-minute political screed

                                                  In 1984, Muhammadu Buhari's government, of which Kuti was a vocal 
                                                  opponent, jailed him on a charge of currency smuggling. Amnesty International 
                                                  and others denounced the charges as politically motivated. Amnesty designated 
                                                  him a prisoner of conscience, and other human rights groups also took up his 
                                                  case. After 20 months, General Ibrahim Babangida released him from prison. 
                                                  On his release, Kuti divorced his 12 remaining wives, citing "marriage brings 
                                                  jealousy and selfishness".

                                                  AIDS activist and former Minister of Health, announced that Kuti had died on 
                                                  the previous day from complications related to AIDS. Kuti had been an AIDS 
                                                  denialist, and his widow maintained that he did not die of AIDS.His youngest 
                                                  son Seun took the role of leading Kuti's former band Egypt 80. As of 2020, 
                                                  the band is still active, releasing music under the moniker Seun Kuti & Egypt 80

                                                  Kuti's musical style is called Afrobeat. It is a style he largely created, and is a 
                                                  complex fusion of jazz, funk, highlife, and traditional Nigerian, African chants 
                                                  and rhythms. It contains elements of psychedelic soul and has similarities to 
                                                  James Brown's style of composition. Afrobeat also borrows heavily from the 
                                                  native "tinker pan". Tony Allen (Kuti's drummer of twenty years) was instrumental 
                                                  in the creation of Afrobeat. Kuti once stated that "there would be no Afrobeat 
                                                  without Tony Allen".

                                                  Kuti's band was notable for featuring two baritone saxophones when most 
                                                  groups only used one. This is a common technique in African and 
                                                  African-influenced musical styles and can be seen in funk and hip hop. 
                                                  His bands sometimes performed with two bassists at the same time both 
                                                  playing interlocking melodies and rhythms. There were always two or 
                                                  more guitarists. The electric West African style guitar in Afrobeat bands 
                                                  is paramount but is used to give basic structure, playing a repeating 
                                                  chordal/melodic statement, riff, or groove.

                                                            Kuti was highly engaged in political activism in Africa from the 
                                                            1970s until his death. He criticized the corruption of Nigerian 
                                                            government officials and the mistreatment of Nigerian citizens. 
                                                            He spoke of colonialism as the root of the socio-economic and 
                                                            political problems that plagued the African people. Corruption 
                                                            was one of the worst political problems facing Africa in the 1970s 
                                                            and Nigeria was among the most corrupt countries. Its government 
                                                            rigged elections and performed coups that ultimately worsened poverty, 
                                                            economic inequality, unemployment, and political instability, further 
                                                            promoting corruption and crime. Kuti's protest songs covered themes 
                                                            inspired by the realities of corruption and socio-economic inequality 
                                                            in Africa. Kuti's political statements could be heard throughout Africa.

                                                            different occasions and spent time in jail, including his longest stint of 20 
                                                            months after his arrest in 1984. On top of jail time, the corrupt government 
                                                            sent soldiers to beat Kuti, his family and friends, and destroy wherever he

                                                            throughout the 1970s signaled a change in the relation between music

                                                            critiqued and insulted the authoritarian then-president of the Federal

                                                            one of his most popular songs, refers to Buhari as an "animal in

                                                            strongly believed in Africa and always preached peace among

                                                            movement also influenced Kuti's political views; he supported 
                                                            Pan-Africanism and socialism and called for a united, democratic 
                                                            African republic. African leaders he supported during his lifetime 
                                                            include Kwame Nkrumah and Thomas Sankara. Kuti was a candid 
                                                            supporter of human rights, and many of his songs are direct attacks 
                                                            against dictatorships, specifically the militaristic governments of 
                                                            Nigeria in the 1970s and 1980s. He also criticized fellow Africans 
                                                            (especially the upper class) for betraying traditional African culture.

                                                  Kuti is remembered as an influential icon who voiced his opinions 
                                                  on matters that affected the nation through his music. Since 1998, 
                                                  the Felabration festival, an idea pioneered by his daughter Yeni Kuti, 
                                                  is held each year at at the New Afrika Shrine to celebrate the life of

                                                  has been a revival of his influence in music and popular culture, 
                                                  culminating in another re-release of his catalog controlled by UMG,

                                                  the 45 albums that it owned and released them on 26 compact discs. 
                                                  These titles were licensed globally, except in Nigeria and Japan, where 
                                                  other companies owned Kuti's music. In 2005, the American operations of 
                                                  UMG licensed all of its world-music titles to the UK-based label Wrasse

                                                  States (where they replaced the titles issues by MCA) and the UK. In 2009,
